ConvertROutputToMatrix
Andrew Fairless, July 2009

This program converts the output of a script written for the statistical program R into the form of a correlation matrix.
This conversion allows the Excel macro written to compare to correlated correlations (according to Steiger 1980) to receive the correlations calculated by the R script as input (i.e., the correlations must be in matrix form).


CorrelCompare
Andrew Fairless, June 2009

This program calculates whether two correlations are significantly different when they are correlated with each other.
The calculations in this program follow Steiger (1980), Tests for Comparing Elements of a Correlation Matrix, Psychological Bulletin, Vol 87 No 2, 245-251.

This program takes a correlation matrix, the number of cases covered by the correlations (N), and the two cells containing the correlations to be compared as input.
